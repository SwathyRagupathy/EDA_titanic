# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to survival rates. It involves cleaning data, visualizing trends, and preparing it for machine learning.

## Key Learnings
- Explored data structure, identified missing values, and handled duplicates.
- Visualized survival patterns by gender, passenger class, and age.
- Created new features like `FamilySize` and `AgeGroup` for deeper insights.
- Detected outliers and studied correlations using heatmaps.
- Cleaned and saved the dataset for future modeling.
